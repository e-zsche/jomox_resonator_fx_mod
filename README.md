# Modding of JoMoX T-Resonator
Within this gist you will find instructions and ideas on how to mod your JoMoX T-Resonator.
The mod you will find here revolves around the FX section of the T-Resonator. What this enables
you to do is change the effects to new ones enabling your T-Resonator to produce different sounds
from the factory settings.

# Shoutouts
Big Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ndf-zz/">ndf-zz</a> who wrote an assembler and disassembler
for the FV-1 chip in Python. Without your work this would not have been this easy. Check out his Python
assembler and disassembler:

Big Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mstratman">mstratman</a> for creating a curated list of FV-1
programs and Thanks to everyone contributing programs to the collection. This made testing new audio
effects on the T-Resonator much easier. Check out the collection of FV-1 programs here:

Resources I came along during the trip down the rabbit hole.

## Resources for FV-1 Chip
IC is manufactured by Spinsemi:

Getting information on how to program this chip is a little harder to obtain. However there
are some infos still around:
